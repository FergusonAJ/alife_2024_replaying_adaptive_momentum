## Predicting the Unpredictable: Using replay experiments to disentangle how evolutionary outcomes are altered by adaptive momentum

This repo contains the supplemental material for our ALife 2024 submission. 

To view the extra plots mentioned in the main paper, see the online supplement here: [https://fergusonaj.github.io/alife_2024_replaying_adaptive_momentum/](https://fergusonaj.github.io/alife_2024_replaying_adaptive_momentum/).

The rest of this repository contains the source code, configuration files, and analyses to replicate this work. 
These files are organized into experiments in the `experiments` subdirectory.
