Prior to these fine-grained replays, we replayed 24 populations at with less precision. We replayed every fourth generation with 1,000 replicates per replay (compared to 10,000 replicates for every generation in the fine-grained replays). Here we show all 24 coarse-grained replays. The functions to generate the plots are not shown here. They can be viewed in /experiments/2024_03_18_01__replays/analysis For each plot, the top subplot shows the potential to cross the first valley (orange line) and the second valley (yellow line). The background of the top subplot shows the expectation based on the position of the leading edge, as in the paper. The bottom subplot shows the state of the population at each generation of the original replicate. 2.1 Dependencies # External library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(cowplot) base_repo_dir = &#39;../..&#39; exp_dir = paste0(base_repo_dir, &#39;/experiments/2024_03_18_01__replays/&#39;) # Internal source(paste0(base_repo_dir, &#39;/global_shared_files/global_analysis_variables.R&#39;)) 2.2 Populations that did not cross 2.2.1 Seed 134 plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;134&#39;) 2.2.2 Seed 158 plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;158&#39;) 2.2.3 Seed 164 plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;164&#39;) 2.2.4 Seed 175 plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;175&#39;) 2.2.5 Seed 252 plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;252&#39;) 2.2.6 Seed 339 Note that this is the seed in Figure 6 of the paper. plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;339&#39;) 2.2.7 Seed 365 plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;365&#39;) 2.2.8 Seed 394 plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;394&#39;) 2.2.9 Seed 446 plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;446&#39;) 2.2.10 Seed 450 plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;450&#39;) 2.3 Populations that crossed once 2.3.1 Seed 011 plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;011&#39;) 2.3.2 Seed 050 plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;050&#39;) 2.3.3 Seed 075 plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;075&#39;) 2.3.4 Seed 083 plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;083&#39;) 2.3.5 Seed 105 plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;105&#39;) 2.3.6 Seed 282 plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;282&#39;) 2.3.7 Seed 343 plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;343&#39;) 2.3.8 Seed 400 Note that this is the seed in Figure 4 of the paper. plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;400&#39;) 2.3.9 Seed 408 plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;408&#39;) 2.3.10 Seed 415 plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;415&#39;) 2.4 Populations that crossed twice 2.4.1 Seed 093 plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;093&#39;) 2.4.2 Seed 124 plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;124&#39;) 2.4.3 Seed 138 plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;138&#39;) 2.4.4 Seed 263 Note that this is the seed in Figure 5 of the paper. plot_replay_with_adjusted_benchmark(&#39;263&#39;) "],["replaying-equilibrium-populations.html", "Section 3 Replaying equilibrium populations 3.1 Dependencies 3.2 Populations that did not cross 3.3 Populations that crossed once 3.4 Populations that crossed twice", " Section 3 Replaying equilibrium populations The paper shows fine-grained replays for one replicate that was NOT experiencing adaptive momentum at the start.

We actually ran 10 shuffled replays, and all of those files are included here. To clarify, for each replayed generation we took the population snapshot at that generation like normal. But for each replicate, we shuffled the organisms in the population prior to starting evolution. This destroyed any existing population structure, though new population structure could evolve again after. The functions to generate the plots are not shown here.
